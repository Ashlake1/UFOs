You can then enter in new search criteria or refresh the site to view the entire table. 

## Summary
One drawback of this site is the limited amount of data - the site does not show sightings outisde of January 2010. 
The site could also be more user friendly by allwoing input for both capital and lower case letters. As of now only lower case input is recognized. Lastly we could add both a "search" and "reset" button.
